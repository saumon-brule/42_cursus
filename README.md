# 42_cursus
My 42 cursus projects

Looks empty ? Look into other branches 👀<br/>
You may want to clone only one projet and not ALL my cursus, here is the command for you :
```
git clone --branch <project> --single-branch https://github.com/saumon-brule/42_cursus.git
```
Btw, the code and some projects may have been updated, if you want the version I pushed to attendance, see the tags
